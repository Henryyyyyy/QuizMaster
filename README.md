# Extra Feature:  

    1. menu item coloring depending on status of the quiz. It's red if it's completed and it's black if it's not  
    ** note that user can distinguish complete and incomplete quizzes even without this feature -- clicking any quiz would give you either the result page, indicating that quiz is completed, or give you the actual quiz, indicating that quiz is not complete  
    2. real time score feedback for both Linear Quiz and Personality Quiz (personality quiz shows total nnumber of questions and how many remaining)  
    3. Just one things that is more than the minimum requirement: killing the app and getting back restores the current quiz question index
